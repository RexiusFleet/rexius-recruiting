-- Phase 7b: the curated manager view gains `furthest_stage_id`, the furthest pipeline stage the
-- application has ever reached (ignoring the two non-hire terminal stages). The Positions page
-- draws a funnel per position (applied -> reviewed -> sent -> interview -> offer -> hired) and
-- counts an application for every stage up to the furthest one it reached, so someone turned
-- down after an interview still counts as interviewed. Staff compute the same number from
-- status_history, which managers cannot read; this column gives them the same funnel.
--
-- `create or replace view` may only append columns, so the new column goes last. Nothing
-- restricted is added: it is a stage id, which managers already see for the current stage.
